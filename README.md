# LinearRegression_withoutLibrary
Linear Regression using gradient descent without library. Take given dataset and minimize the loss function using gradient descent algorithm and find the optimum value of parameters θ1, θ2. Also plot the best fit of line.



I HAVE WRITTEN TWO CODE ONE WITHOUT USING NUMPY LIBRARY AND ONE WITH USING NUMPY LIBRARY, NUMPY MAKE THE WORK EASY AND COMPUTATIONALLY FASTER AS IT USES GPU'S FOR COMPUTATION. SO IT IS RECOMMENDED.
